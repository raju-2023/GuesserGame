There is one guesser, one umpire and three players in this game. After guessing a number, the guesser will give that number to the umpire and keep it with him. The umpire will now ask those three players to guess the numbers.  Then it will store those numbers with itself.  Then these numbers will be matched with the guesser's numbers.  The player whose numbers match will win.  The guesser will tell which player won.  If the player's numbers do not match, the guesser will say try again.
